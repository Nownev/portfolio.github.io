### Hello, I'm Suhani 👋

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and making an impact through creative solutions. 
Here's a glimpse into my journey:  


## 🛠️ Projects

### **HOMELESS AND PUBLIC SERVICES**  

**OVERVIEW:** 
1. Lack of Access to Schools
Schools may be located far from slums, making attendance difficult.
Insufficient number of schools to cater to growing populations in slums.
2. Poverty
Families often prioritize earning over education, leading children to work instead of attending school.
Inability to afford uniforms, books, and fees.
3. Poor Infrastructure
Overcrowded classrooms and lack of basic facilities like clean drinking water, toilets, or proper lighting.
Inadequate teaching materials and resources.
4. Social Barriers
Stigma and discrimination against slum residents can discourage children from attending school.
Gender inequality, where girls may face additional barriers like early marriage or safety concerns.
**Technical Stack:**  
Languages: C++, Java
Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, A*, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques
**Impact:** 
1. Enhanced Resource Allocation:
Ensures resources like food, shelter, and medical aid reach the most vulnerable families efficiently.
2. Increased Transparency:
Provides a systematic and fair approach to aid distribution, promoting trust among beneficiaries.
3. Data-Driven Interventions:
Facilitates the identification of critical needs, enabling NGOs to design targeted and impactful programs.
4. Improved Living Conditions:
Timely and tailored assistance leads to better hygiene, health, and overall living standards in slum areas.
